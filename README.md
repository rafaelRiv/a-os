# A-OS

A research RISC-V OS written in ATS ((http://www.ats-lang.org/). The goal is to explore concepts used in ATS to
make an OS that can be formally verified at compile time. A-OS do not have the goal to be a complete OS. 
It aimns at making Idris2 a better system language and thus concepts explored are expected to be rejected or to be
eventually included in Idris2. The medium to explore those concepts in Idris2 is [Pi-OS](https://github.com/rafaelRiv/pi-os).

Please be patient. This is just the beginnings of the journey.
